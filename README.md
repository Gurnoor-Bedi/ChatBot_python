# Simple Python Chatbot

This repository contains a basic Python chatbot script that responds to user inputs with predefined responses. The chatbot uses regular expressions for pattern matching to determine the appropriate response.

## Features

- Responds to specific user inputs with predefined text.
- Uses regular expressions for input matching.
- Continuously interacts with the user until manually stopped.

## Usage

Run the script, and then type your message to the chatbot. The chatbot will respond based on its predefined responses. If it doesn't recognize the input, it will respond with a default message.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- NLTK library

### Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Install the NLTK library using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install nltk
    ```

### Running the Script

1. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
2. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
